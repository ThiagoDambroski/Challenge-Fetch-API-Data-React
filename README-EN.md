# Challenge React API - Dave Gray

This repository contains a solution to the challenge proposed by Dave Gray in **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf_uNOKVSnM&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PrE9srvEn8nbhOOyxnWXfp&index=16)**. The challenge involves fetching and displaying data as a table from the following URLs:

1. **[Users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)**
2. **[Posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)**
3. **[Comments](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments)**

The solution also includes the implementation of three buttons to switch between the data fetched from these URLs.

To see the solution, please visit the [src folder](https://github.com/ThiagoDambroski/challenge-react-dave-gray/tree/master/src).
